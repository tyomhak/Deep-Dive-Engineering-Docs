Current environment allows us to have sequence of values of different types.

```cpp
/// Recursive implementation of a multitype sequence.
template< typename HeadType, HeadType Head, typename BodyType >
struct ct_multitype_sequence
{
    /// Type of head value of this sequence.
    typedef HeadType head_type;

    /// Head value of this sequence.
    static constexpr HeadType head = Head;

    /// Continuation of this sequence.
    typedef BodyType body_type;

    /// Length of this sequence.
    static constexpr unsigned int length = body_type::length + 1;
};
  

// Forward declaration for the empty sequence.
// Note, there is no need to define another kind of empty multitype
// sequence.
struct ct_empty_sequence;

int main()
{
	typedef ct_multitype_sequence< int, 19,
		ct_multitype_sequence< long long, 45'674'005'354'012,
			ct_multitype_sequence< char, 'g',
				ct_multitype_sequence< int, 42, ct_empty_sequence > > > > a1;
	
	// Printing length
	cout << "Length of the sequence is " << a1::length << endl;
	
	// Addressing by index
	// Note, we use the same 'ct_at<>' metafunction.
	cout << "Value at index '1' is " << ct_at< a1, 1 >::value << endl;
	cout << "Value at index '2' is " << ct_at< a1, 2 >::value << endl;
	
	// Printing the sequence
	// Note, we use the same 'ct_printer<>' metafunction.
	ct_printer< a1 >::print();
	
	cout << endl;
}
```

So in some sense, at compile time WE CAN DO MORE, compared to runtime.
