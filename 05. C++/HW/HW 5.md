##### Exercise 1  
Assume we have:
 * collection of receivers,
 * collection of transformers,
 * collection of senders.
A Combiner works on one receiver, one transformer and one sender.
Write a logger (function or class) for behavior of provided Combiner. Logger must instantiate the Combiner with certain triples of {receiver, transformer, sender}.
