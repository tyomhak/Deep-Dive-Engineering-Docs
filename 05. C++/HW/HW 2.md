# Introduction to metaprogramming
Write template structures, which will perform the following calculations during compilation phase:
- [ ] Power `a^N`, where `N` is an integer
	- [ ] using O(N) instantiations
	- [ ] using O(log N) instantiations. 
- [ ] Absolute |X| of given value 'X'
- [ ] Maximal of 3 values {A, B, C}
- [ ] Number of digits of given integer 'N'
- [ ] Number of divisors of 'N'

# Manipulations with types  
Write templated structures, which will return the following characteristics  
for provided type 'T':  
- [ ] Check if 'T' represents a plain array,  
- [ ] Check if 'T' is a pointer
- [ ] Check if 2 argument types 'T' and 'U' are the same type
- [ ] Return size (extent) of provided static array type 'T'
- [ ] Return dimensionality (rank) of provided static multidimensional array type 'U'.
