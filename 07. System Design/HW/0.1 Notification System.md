A notification system has already become a very popular feature for many applications in recent years. A notification alerts a user with important information like breaking news, product updates, events, offerings, etc. It has become an indispensable part of our daily life. In this chapter, you are asked to design a notification system. A notification is more than just mobile push notification. Three types of notification formats are: mobile push notification, SMS message, and Email.  

Design a **Notification Service** that supports sending **push notifications** to **iOS and Android devices**, as well as **emails** and **SMS messages**. The service should expose APIs or interfaces that allow other services to trigger these notifications. Focus on system components, communication flows, and scalability considerations.

# Solution

Vocabulary for my questions:  
_targets_ - apps/emails/numbers that the notifications will be sent to.  
_users_ - owners of the targets.
**My questions for the notification system:**
**Functional**  
1. Should it work real-time?  
2. Should it support scheduled notifications (e.g. send notifs at 12:00pm)?  
3. Does the notification need to be pre-processed before being sent (e.g. replace a placeholder with the user's name)?  
4. Data-Collection? e.g. how many emails have been opened, and by which users?  
5. What filtering options are available for the requests (e.g. send notifs only to emails, only target selected group of users...)  
6. Keep history of requests?  
7. Can users/targets opt-out?  
8. What data will be stored per user (other than number, email, device token). For example full name.

**Throughput**  
1. Expected number of requests per day?  
2. Expected number of targets?  
3. Expected average size of notification data?

**Latency**  
1. Max response time?  
2. Max delay between request, and users receiving the notification?  
3. Geographic location of targets? Worldwide or region limited.

**Availability**
1. Availability % per year, max down time?

**Legal**  
1. GDPR compliance?
