The advantage of threads to processes is the ability for the parallel entities to share an address space and all of its data among themselves. This ability is essential for certain applications, which is why having multiple processes (with their separate address spaces) will not work.

Also they are significantly lighter than processes: faster to create and destroy (10-100 times faster).

We can gain significant performance improvement from threads. If there is substantial computing and substantial I/O, threads allows overlapping of these activities.

Finally, threads are useful on multi-CPU systems, where real parallelism is possible.

A thread contains:
1. program counter that keeps track of which instruction to execute next
2. registers which hold its current values
3. stack which contains execution history, with one frame for each procedure called but not yet returned from. This frame contains the procedureâ€™s local variables and the return address to use when the procedure call has finished.

> [!IMPORTANT] [Processes](obsidian://open?vault=Deep%20Dive%20Engineering&file=01.%20Concurrency%2F01.%20Processes) are used to group resources together; threads are the entities scheduled for execution on the CPU.

What threads add to the process model is to allow multiple executions to take place in the same process environment, to a large degree independent of one another. The threads share an address space and other resources.

Like a traditional process (i.e., a process with only one thread), a thread can be in any one of several states: running, blocked, ready, or terminated.
