### **OS Schedulers**

An **OS scheduler** manages how processes and threads are assigned to the CPU. It decides which task runs next, ensuring efficient CPU usage and fair resource distribution.
### **Preemptive vs. Non-Preemptive Scheduling**

- **Preemptive Scheduling**: The OS can interrupt a running process and switch to another (e.g., Round Robin, SRTF, CFS).
- **Non-Preemptive Scheduling**: A running process keeps the CPU until it finishes or voluntarily releases it (e.g., FCFS, SJF).

### **Types of OS Process Schedulers**

1. **Long-Term Scheduler (Job Scheduler)**
    - Decides **which processes to admit** into the system for execution.
    - Controls the **degree of multiprogramming** (number of processes in memory).
    - Runs **infrequently** (e.g., when a new job is submitted).
    - Example: A batch processing system deciding which jobs to load into memory.

2. **Short-Term Scheduler (CPU Scheduler)**
    - Decides **which process gets the CPU next**.
    - Runs **very frequently** (every few milliseconds).
    - Uses different scheduling algorithms (e.g., FCFS, RR, SJF, etc.).
    - Example: Switching between processes in a multitasking OS.

3. **Medium-Term Scheduler (Swapper)**
    - Temporarily **removes processes from memory** (swapping).
    - Helps **free up RAM** by moving inactive processes to disk.
    - Runs **occasionally**, depending on system load.
    - Example: Inactive background processes are swapped to disk in low-memory situations.
