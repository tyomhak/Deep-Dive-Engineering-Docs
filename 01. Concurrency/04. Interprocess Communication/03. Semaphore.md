A **semaphore** is a synchronization primitive used in concurrent programming to manage access to shared resources and prevent [race conditions](01.%20Race%20Condition.md). It is essentially a counter that controls how many threads or processes can access a resource at a time.

### **Types of Semaphores**

1. **Binary Semaphore (Mutex)**
    - Only takes values **0 or 1** (locked/unlocked).
    - Used for **mutual exclusion** (ensures only one thread accesses a resource at a time).
    - Similar to a **mutex**, but with subtle differences (e.g., semaphores do not have ownership, but mutexes do).

2. **Counting Semaphore**
    - Holds a non-negative integer value.
    - Allows multiple threads to access a limited number of resources (e.g., a pool of connections).
### **Basic Operations**

3. **Wait (P operation / down /  `sem_wait`)**
    - Decreases the semaphore value.
    - If the value is **> 0**, the process/thread proceeds.
    - If **0**, the process **blocks** until another thread signals.

4. **Signal (V operation / up / `sem_post`)**
    - Increases the semaphore value.
    - Wakes up a waiting process if any.

### **Example Use Case**

A printing system with **3 printers** can use a **counting semaphore initialized to 3**. Each thread must acquire (`wait`) before using a printer and release (`signal`) when done.
