**IPC** - **Inter-Process Communication**

Situations where two or more [processes](01.%20Processes.md) are reading or writing some shared data and the final result depends on who runs precisely when, are called **race conditions**.

Part of the time, a process is busy doing internal computations and other things that do not lead to race conditions. However, sometimes a process has to access shared memory or files, or do other critical things that can lead to races. That part of the program where the shared memory is accessed is called the critical region or critical section.

We need four conditions to hold to have a good solution to avoiding race conditions: 
1. No two processes may be simultaneously inside their critical regions. 
2. No assumptions may be made about speeds or the number of CPUs. 
3. No process running outside its critical region may block any process. 
4. No process should have to wait forever to enter its critical region.


Mechanisms for avoiding the race condition problems in multi-[threading](02.%20Threads.md):
1. [Spinlock](02.%20Spinlock.md)
2. [Semaphore](03.%20Semaphore.md)
3. [Mutex](04.%20Mutex.md)
4. [Monitors](05.%20Monitors.md)
5. [Barriers](06.%20Barriers.md)

If not used carefully, these mechanisms can create a [deadlock](09.%20Deadlocks.md) situation.

Famous IPC problems:
1. [ABA Problem](ABA%20Problem.md)
2. [Producer & Consumer Problem](Producer%20&%20Consumer%20Problem.md)
3. [Priority Inversion](01.%20Concurrency/04.%20Interprocess%20Communication/Priority%20Inversion.md)
