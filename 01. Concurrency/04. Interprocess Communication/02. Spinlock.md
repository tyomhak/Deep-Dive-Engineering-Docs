The integer variable *turn*, initially 0, keeps track of whose turn it is to enter the critical region and examine or update the shared memory. Initially, process 0 inspects turn, finds it to be 0, and enters its critical region. Process 1 also finds it to be 0 and therefore sits in a tight loop continually testing turn to see when it becomes 1. Continuously testing a variable until some value appears is called **busy waiting**. It should usually be avoided, since it wastes CPU time. Only when there is a reasonable expectation that the wait will be short is busy waiting used. A lock that uses busy waiting is called a **spin lock**.

# TSL Instruction
> [!NOTE] TSL - Test & Set Lock

```
TSL RX,LOCK
```
this command reads the contents of the `LOCK` memory word into register RX, and writes a nonzero value at the memory address lock. Its atomicity must be guaranteed by hardware. The CPU executing `TSL` locks the memory bus, to prevent other CPUs from accessing memory until it is done.

An alternative to `TSL` is `XCHG`, which exchanges the contents of two locations atomically, for example a register and a memory word. All Intel x86 CPUs use `XCHG` for synchronization.

Both Peterson's solution and TSL are prone to [Priority Inversion](01.%20Concurrency/04.%20Interprocess%20Communication/Priority%20Inversion.md) problem.
