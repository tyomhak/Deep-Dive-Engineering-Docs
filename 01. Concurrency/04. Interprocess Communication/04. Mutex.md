A **mutex** is a shared variable that can be in one of two states: unlocked or locked.

If the mutex is already locked, the thread calling `mutex_lock` is blocked until the thread in the critical region is finished and calls `mutex_unlock`. If multiple threads are blocked on the mutex, one of them is chosen at random and allowed to acquire the lock.
