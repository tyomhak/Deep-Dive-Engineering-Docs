# Introduction
##### Terminology

| Process              | a program in execution. It consists of data, resources, state and a virtualized computer |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Binary / Program** | compiled, executable code lying on a storage medium (e.g. HDD)                           |
| PID (process id)     | unique process identifier                                                                |
| multiprogramming     | rapid switching back and forth between processes by the CPU                              |
| pseudoparallelism    | multiprogramming, creating illusion of parallelism                                       |
| multiprocessor       | two or more CPUs sharing the same physical memory                                        |


**Foreground Processes** interact with users, and perform work for them.
**Background Processes** are not associated with particular users, but instead have some specific function, for example accept incoming email, accept requests for web pages. Processes that stay in the background to handle some activity such as email, web pages, news and so on are called **daemons**.

A process contains:
- binary image loaded into memory
- instance of virtualized memory
- kernel resources
	- open files
	- security context (such as associated user)
- one or more [threads](02.%20Threads.md)

Each thread has its own virtualized processor, which includes:
- a stack
- processor state (such as registers)
- instruction pointer

In a single threaded process:
- process is the thread
- one instance of virtualized memory
- one virtualized processor
Multithreaded process:
- multiple threads
- virtualization of memory is associated with the process
- threads all share the same memory address space


- The `idle` process (pid = 0) is the process that runs when there are no other runnable processes.
- The `init` process (pid = 1) is the first process that the kernel executes after booting, and it handles the remainder of the boot process, such as initializing the system, starting various services, and launching a login program.

Every process has a parent process that spawned it, creating a hierarchy of processes. Parent's ID is stored in a process's `ppid` (parent pid).
Each process is owned by a user and a group. Child processes inherit their parent's user/group ownership.


`pid_t` - type for PID, `<sys/types.h>`
`pid_t get_pid(void)` - `<unistd.h>`


##### Four principal events causing processes to be created:
1. System initialization
2. Execution of a process-creation system call by a running process.
3. A user request to create a new process.
4. Initiation of a batch job.

# Running a New Process

In Unix the act of running a new process is split into two steps: `fork` and `exec`.
- `Fork` duplicates the current process, creating a new one.
- `Exec` loads a binary program into memory, replacing the previous contents of the address space, and begins execution of the new program.
When combined: you duplicate your running process with `fork` and then replace the contents of the clone process with a new program using `exec`. The reason for this two step process is to allow the child to modify its file descriptors, in order to accomplish redirection of standard input/output/error.

---
## Exec
- `int execl(const char *path, const char* arg, ...)` 
	`path` - path to program, including the name
	`arg`  - the program name (so a program can examine the name of its binary image)
	returns `-1` in case of failure.
- `int execlp(const char *file, const char *arg, ...);`
- `int execle(const char *path, const char *arg, ...);`
- `int execv(const char *file, char *const  argv[]);`
- `int execvp(const char *file, char *const argv[]);`
- `int execve(const char *filename, char *const argv[], char *const envp[]);`
where:
`l` - arguments are provided via a list
`v` - arguments are provided via a vector (array). 
`p` - user's full `path` is searched for the given name
`e` - new environment is supplied for the new process

> [!NOTE] Both list and vector args must be null terminated 
> example: `{ "vi", "/home/kidd/hooks.txt", NULL };`

### On successful `execl`:

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| pending signals are lost                                                                                   | PID                                                                |
| memory locks are dropped                                                                                   | PPID                                                               |
| thread attributes are reset                                                                                | priority                                                           |
| process stats are reset                                                                                    | owning user & group                                                |
| anything related to process's memory address space is cleared<br>(including any mapped files)              | open files <br>(although it's preferable to close them beforehand) |
| anything that exists solely in user space is cleared<br>(including C library features, such as `atexit()`) |                                                                    |

## Fork
- `pid_t fork (void);`  
Creates a new process (child) identical to the invoking process (parent) in almost all aspects.

Returns:
- 0 in the new process instance
- the pid of the new process in the original instance
- -1 in case of an error. `errno` is set appropriately.

Differences between parent and child processes:
- return value of `fork()` call
- pid
- ppid
- resource stats are reset to zero in child
- pending signals are cleared and not inherited by the child
- acquired file locks are not inherited by the child.

#### Copy-on-write (COW)
In early Unix systems upon `fork` invocation, the kernel created copies of all internal data structures, duplicated the process's page table entries and then performed a page-by-page copy of parent's address space into the child's new address space.


Modern Unix systems (such as Linux) employ copy-on-write (COW) pages.
COW is a lazy optimization that mitigates the overhead of duplicating resources, until necessary.
The child process uses the parent's resources, until there's an attempt to modify them. When a write operation is requested on a part of a chunk of memory, the chunk is copied before executing the write operation.

## Example of `fork` & `exec` combo

```c
pid_t pid; 

pid = fork ();
if (pid == −1) 
	perror ("fork"); 
	
/* the child ... */ 
if (!pid) { 
	const char *args[] = { "windlass", NULL }; 
	int ret; 
	
	ret = execv ("/bin/windlass", args); 
	if (ret == −1) { 
		perror ("execv");
		exit (EXIT_FAILURE); 
	} 
}
```

# Process Termination
A process can terminate due to one of the following conditions:
1. Normal Exit (voluntary)
2. Error Exit (voluntary)
3. Fatal error (involuntary)
4. Killed by another process (involuntary)

In some systems, once a process is terminated, all of its child processes are terminated as well. This is not the case with UNIX or Windows.

---
# Process Hierarchies
In some systems, when a parent process creates a child process, they continue to be associated via a process hierarchy.
In UNIX this hierarchy of processes is called a process group. When a signal comes from a keyboard, it is passed to all of the processes that the keyboard is associated with. Each process can choose to catch the signal, ignore it, or take the default action, which is to be killed by the signal.

In Windows all processes are equal, and a hierarchy is absent. Upon creation of a child process the parent receives a special token (a handle) to the child process, but it can pass it to another process, thus invalidating any resemblance of a hierarchy.

---
# Process States
The three states a process may be in (short version):
1. Running (actually using the CPU at that instant)
2. Ready (runnable; temporarily stopped to let another process run)
3. Blocked (unable to run until some external event happens)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250214021700.png)
Transitions 2 and 3 are caused by the [process scheduler](0.%20Process%20Scheduler.md).

>[!WARNING] In reality there are more process states (Zombie...), which I'm skipping at the moment for the sake of simplicity.

# Implementation

OS maintains a **process table**, with one entry per process. These entries are often called **process control blocks**. 

Process control block contains:
1. information about the process' state
2. including its program counter
3. stack pointer, memory allocation
4. the status of its open files
5. its accounting and scheduling information
6. everything else that must be saved before changing from *running* to *ready* or *blocked* states, so that it can be restarted later, as if it had never been stopped.
