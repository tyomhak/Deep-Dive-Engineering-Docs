Almost everything in life can be represented as a system.

# Object-Oriented Paradigm
Objects, representing things in code, help the code to stay organized, flexible, and reusable. 
- Objects keep code organized by putting related details and specific functions in distinct, easy-to-find places. 
- Objects keep code flexible, so details can be easily changed in a modular way within the object, without affecting the rest of the code. 
- Objects allow code to be reused, as they reduce the amount of code that needs to be created.
