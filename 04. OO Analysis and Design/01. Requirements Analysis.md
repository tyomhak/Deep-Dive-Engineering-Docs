When starting a new project, the very first thing that must be done is requirements analysis.

> [!IMPORTANT] **Requirements** are conditions or capabilities that must be implemented in a product, based on client or user request.

# Types of requirements
- **Functional** - what the system or application is expected to do. Features, capabilities, security. 
- **Non-Functional** - how well the system or application does what it does. Performance, resource usage, and efficiency. ("everything else")

A popular model for requirements classification is **FURPS+**
*Functional* - what the system or application is expected to do.
*Usability* - human factors, help, documentation.
*Reliability* - frequency of failure, recoverability, predictability.
*Performance* - response times, throughput, accuracy, availability, resource usage.
*Supportability* - adaptability, maintainability, internationalization, configurability.
*Other* - Implementation, Interface, Operations, Legal
# Quality Attributes
Some of these requirements are collectively called quality attributes, quality requirements, or the  "-ilities" of a system.
From a developer's perspective, during OOA&D, outlined quality attributes need to be emphasized during design and implementation.

| Maintainability | The ease at which your system is capable of undergoing changes.                                                                                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reusability     | The extent in which functions or parts of your system can be used in another. (helps reduce the cost of re-implementing something that has already been done) |
| Flexibility     | How well a system can adapt to requirements change.                                                                                                           |
| Modifiability   |                                                                                                                                                               |
| Testability     |                                                                                                                                                               |


# Supplementary specification

# Trade-offs
Having all of the requirements listed above is not realistic, and trade-offs must be done.
For example:
- Performance vs Security
- Performance vs Maintainability

# Organizing requirements

## Risk
## Coverage
## Criticality




# UML
Unified Modeling Language

First approach to collecting requirements is creating a **Use-Case**, and then a **Conceptual Design** diagrams.
## Use-Case diagram 
Summarize the details of your system's users (also known as actors) and their interactions with the system. 
An effective use case diagram can help your team discuss and represent:
- Scenarios in which your system or application interacts with people, organizations, or external systems.
- Goals that your system or application helps those entities (known as actors) achieve.
- The scope of your system.

## Class Responsibility Collaborator

CRC cards are used to record, organize, and refine the components of system design.
They are designed with three sections: the class name at the top, the responsibilities on the left, and the collaborators on the right.

## Conceptual Design Diagram 
contains abstracted entities and their
- relations to each other
- responsibilities
